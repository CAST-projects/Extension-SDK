Presentation
============

This document describes a way to implement DotNet Quality Rules (aka QR)
based on Microsoft DiagnosticAnalyzer framework using an SDK named
CastDotNetExtension.

These QR can be written in C# language and are designed to be processed
by the analyzer itself, using its own environment (i.e. the context of
the analysis).

In a nutshell, this mechanism allows a user to attach callback functions
to some nodes of an AST generated by Roslyn. During the visit of this
AST by the analyzer, these functions will be automatically called each
time these nodes are encountered.

A template has been developed to help implementing these rules and the
corresponding unit tests (independent from Cast ecosystem).

Description
===========

During its initialization, the DotNet analyzer browses through all the
existing extensions and searches for all the assemblies which name
contains "CastQualityRules" (e.g. "RobustnessCastQualityRules.dll").
These assemblies will then be loaded and all the QRs will be added to
the analyzer’s internal QRs list.

To identify a QR, the analyzer will look at 2 points:

1. A QR is a class inheriting from
   **CastDotNetExtension.AbstractRuleChecker**.

2. Some mandatory annotations should be present to activate and identify
   the QR.

The AbstractRuleChecker class
-----------------------------

This class is the backbone of a QR. It contains all the methods and
properties required to define and execute a QR. It will also provide the
results after being processed.

To create a QR, you have to inherit from this class and override the
abstract method “\ **Init**\ ”. Here you will declare all the
associations between AST nodes and the corresponding callbacks.

In these callbacks you can call the method “\ **AddViolation**\ ” to
record a new violation of the QR.

Then, you can get the results through the “\ **Violations**\ ” property.

Example
~~~~~~~

First, let’s see a simple example of a basic QR: Avoid Using Goto in
your code.

Here would be the implementation of this rule, based on
**AbstractRuleChecker**:

::


   public class AvoidUseOfGoto : AbstractRuleChecker
   {
       public override void Init(AnalysisContext context)
       {
           context.RegisterSyntaxNodeAction(this.VisitGoto, SyntaxKind.GotoStatement);
       }

       private void VisitGoto(SyntaxNodeAnalysisContext nodeContext)
       {
           AddViolation(nodeContext);
       }
   }

In this example, we have declared the callback function: **VisitGoto.**
Then we have associated this function to a type of nodes
(**SyntaxKind.GotoStatement**) using the method
**AnalysisContext.RegisterSyntaxNodeAction()**.

Presentation of the API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::


   namespace CastDotNetExtension
   {
     public abstract class AbstractRuleChecker : DiagnosticAnalyzer, IDisposable
     {
       protected AbstractRuleChecker();
       protected AbstractRuleChecker(ViolationCreationMode creationMode)

       public virtual string GetRuleName()
       public override ImmutableArray<DiagnosticDescriptor> SupportedDiagnostics { get; }

       public abstract void Init(AnalysisContext context);
       public virtual void Reset();

       public void AddViolation(SyntaxNodeAnalysisContext node, bool setBookmark = true);
       public void AddViolation(SyntaxNodeAnalysisContext node, 
                         IEnumerable<FileLinePositionSpan> bookmarks);
       public void AddViolation(ISymbol symbol, IEnumerable<FileLinePositionSpan> bookmarks,
                         SyntaxTreeAnalysisContext context);
       public void AddViolation(ISymbol symbol, IEnumerable<FileLinePositionSpan> bookmarks);

       public ViolationBuilder Violations { get; set; }

       public ParameterValue GetParameterValue(string name);

       public ILog Log;

       public ISymbol GetSymbol(SyntaxNodeAnalysisContext node);
     }
   }

“AbstractRuleChecker” Constructor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A creation mode can be provided in order to indicate the kind of
bookmarking that will be applied:

-  **NoViolation**: no bookmark registered. Usually used for metrics.

-  **OneViolationPerNode**: Each AST node or bookmark provided will be
   registered as a violation with one bookmark.

-  **ViolationWithAdditionalBookmarks**: When reporting a violation with
   a list of bookmarks, only one violation will be recorded at the first
   position of the list, the remaining bookmarks will simply be
   associated to it as “additional bookmarks”.

The default value is “\ **OneViolationPerNode**\ ”.

“Init” Method 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This method will be automatically called each time a new context is
setup in the analyzer (i.e. before starting the visit of an AST).

This method must contain the registrations of all the callback functions
you want to set up.

A callback function must have the following signature:

::

   private void <NameOfTheFunction>(SyntaxNodeAnalysisContext nodeContext)

Where **<NameOfTheFunction>** is the callback’s name of your choice.

Note: **Init** is an abstract method therefore it must be defined for
each QR.

“Reset” Method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This method optional. It is virtual and can be overridden if you need to
initialize and/or clean your own specific data.

This function is called during the initialization (just before calling
the aforementioned “\ **Init**\ ” method) and when the QR is being
disposed of.

“AddViolation” Methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The purpose of this method is to record a new violation for the current
instance of the QR.

If a context is provided, then the diagnostic will also be reported to
the **CodeAnalysis** environment (calling **ReportDiagnostic** method on
the given context)

This method has 4 overloads:

1. Automatic bookmarking. Depending on the value of the **setBookmark**
   parameter, this method will add a violation at the position of the
   given node (**setBookmark=true**) or at the position of the
   containing symbol (**setBookmark=false**).

::

   public void AddViolation(SyntaxNodeAnalysisContext node, bool setBookmark = true);

2. User bookmarking. The violation will be recorded with the given
   bookmarks. If the list of bookmarks is empty, then the behavior is
   the same as the previous overload with **setBookmark=false**.

::

   public void AddViolation(SyntaxNodeAnalysisContext node,
                            IEnumerable<FileLinePositionSpan> bookmarks);

3. User symbol and User bookmarking. The violation will be recorded with
   the given bookmarks and associated to the given symbol (**ISymbol**
   type). The **SyntaxTreeAnalysisContext** parameter is only provided
   to report the diagnostic to **CodeAnalysis** environment.

::

   public void AddViolation(ISymbol symbol, IEnumerable<FileLinePositionSpan> bookmarks,
                            SyntaxTreeAnalysisContext context);

4. User symbol and User bookmarking. The violation will be recorded with
   the given bookmarks and associated to the given symbol (**ISymbol**
   type).

::

   public void AddViolation(ISymbol symbol, IEnumerable<FileLinePositionSpan> bookmarks);

“GetSymbol” Method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This function returns the closest symbol containing the given node.

*Note: a symbol has the same definition as in Roslyn: it represents a
symbol (namespace, class, method, parameter, etc.) exposed by the
compiler.*

“GetRuleName” Method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This method returns the Title property of the configured RuleDescription
attribute (see below).

“CastPropertyName” Method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This property contains the name of the QR in the Cast analyzer
ecosystem, i.e. the MetaModel property name qualified with the
containing category name.

Example: “\ **AvoidUsingGoto.number**\ ” where “\ **AvoidUsingGoto**\ ”
is the category and “\ **number**\ ” is the property.

The value of this property is automatically set when the QR is loaded
from the extension (see the RuleDescription Attribute description below)

“Violations” Property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This property is valued with the list of all the violations found during
the visit of an AST. In other words, all the violations, added using the
**AddViolation** method, are stored in this property.

“GetParameterValue” Property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This method retrieve the parameter value given a parameter's name.
The name is one of those defined in the AssessmentModel (in IMPLParameters.xml file).
It returns an object of the **ParameterValue** class.

“Log” Property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This property is based on Log4Net

Annotations identifying a QR
----------------------------

Your specialization of **CastDotNetExtension.AbstractRuleChecker**
allows you to implement the QR behaviour. But the analyzer will need
some way to identify the QR and this is done using annotations.

There are 3 annotations which must be associated with your QR:
**CastRuleChecker**, **DiagnosticAnalyzer** and **RuleDescription**.

CastRuleChecker annotation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This annotation is very simple and not parametrized. It is merely a flag
indicating to the DotNet Analyzer that this is an active
CastDotNetExtension.

If this annotation is removed, then the analyzer will simply ignore this
QR.

DiagnosticAnalyzer annotation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This annotation is used by **Microsoft.CodeAnalysis** mechanism. It is
parametrized by the language of the code to analyze. Typically,
**LanguageNames.CSharp**, **LanguageNames.FSharp** or
**LanguageNames.VisualBasic**.

RuleDescription annotation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This annotation is used to provide some functional information about the
QR. It is parametrized by 2 types of data:

1. All the parameters required by
   **Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.DiagnosticDescriptor** such as its Id,
   Title, Description, etc. All these data are used by the
   **Microsoft.CodeAnalysis** environment.

2. | One Cast specific AND mandatory parameter: **CastProperty** which
     must be valued with the MetaModel Property name (qualified by its
     Category name) corresponding to the QR you are defining. E.g.
     “\ **AvoidClassesWithTooManyConstructorsAnalyzer.number**\ ”.
   | This information will be the one stored in the **ViolationName**
     property of the **AbstractRuleChecker** class.

Example: The example seen above would become this:

::


   [CastRuleChecker]
   [DiagnosticAnalyzer(LanguageNames.CSharp)]
   [RuleDescription(
      Id = "AvoidUseOfGoto",
      Title = "Use of goto statement",
      MessageFormat = "Avoid using goto statement other than goto case",
      Category = "Maintainability",
      DefaultSeverity = DiagnosticSeverity.Warning,
      ConstRemediationCost = 2,
      CastProperty = "AvoidUseOfGoto.number"
   )]
   public class AvoidUseOfGoto : AbstractRuleChecker
   {
       public override void Init(AnalysisContext context)
       {
           context.RegisterSyntaxNodeAction(this.VisitGoto, SyntaxKind.GotoStatement);
       }

       private void VisitGoto(SyntaxNodeAnalysisContext nodeContext)
       {
           AddViolation(nodeContext);
       }
   }

Creating a QR with CastDotNetExtension
======================================

Now that we have seen how to implement the QR, we need to see how it can
be turned into an extension that can be integrated into the Cast
environment.

An extension is basically one (or more) assemblies providing some
services (analyzer, QualityRules or Dataflow computation, etc.) It
should come in a package of self-sufficient assemblies and configuration
files. Practically, this usually means providing all the external
assemblies required by the QR, the MetaModel and AssessmentModel files.

In order to ease the development of these extensions, Cast provides a
small Development Kit containing a simple template of an extension (i.e.
**TemplateCastQualityRules**) and a basic Unit Testing project (i.e.
**UnitTestTemplateCastQualityRules**). These 2 projects come ready to
use and they contain all the required assemblies.

A Visual solution and the 2 projects are provided in order to set
everything in place: TemplateCastQualityRules.sln

.. image:: roslyn_template.png
   :width: 6.5in
   :height: 3.925in

Figure 1 - The CastDotNetExtension template solution

In this template, all the names are obviously generic and should be
changed to adapt to your own needs. This applies of course to the name
of the QR but also to all the files and projects (sln, csproj and xml
files).

Using TemplateCastQualityRule project to implement a QR
-------------------------------------------------------

This is the central project of the solution. Building this project will
generate a ready to use extension. Therefore, you have to provide a name
for the resulting assembly corresponding to the set of QRs it will
contain. You are free to give any name as long as it ends with the
discriminating postfix “\ **CastQualityRule**\ ”. E.g.
**PerformanceDiagnosticsCastQualityRules.dll**

*Note: In order to help using the template, we have added some tags in
the files of the project and in this doc in order to easily find each
element. These tags are as follow:* **[TODO#<index>]** *where <index> is
a number. E.g.* **[TODO#1]**\ *,* **[TODO#7]**\ *, etc.*

MetaModel
~~~~~~~~~

The project contains some nested folders
(“Configuration\\Languages\\DotNet”) that should contain all the
MetaModel xml files required by your extension.

You can have as many files as you wish with any name as you like but
these names must end with the “\ **MetaModel.xml**\ ” postfix. E.g.
**PerformanceDiagnosticsMetaModel.xml**. At runtime, all the MetaModel
files will be loaded and aggregated in memory.

In Cast products each QualityRule is identified by a property. It can be
identified in 2 ways:

-  | The property name (qualified with the name of the category it
     belongs to).
   | Ex: “\ **ExampleCustomQualityRules.myQualityRule**\ ”

-  The property id (numerical) that must be unique (among the other
   property ids). See below.

| In order to simplify the handling of unique ids across the whole Cast
  environment, we provide a mechanism allowing the use of relative ids.
  To do so, you simply have to set your MetaModel as “client” (in
  opposition to the default “core” status of the standard MetaModel
  files) and then, define an offset that will be apply to all your
  relative ids.
| Here is the declaration of a client MetaModel file:

::

   <metaModel file_level="client" file_no="99">
      <!-- your declarations here -->
   </metaModel>

| In this example, the “\ **file_level**\ ” attribute has been se to
  “\ **client**\ ” and the “\ **file_no**\ ” defines the offset that
  will be applied to all the relative ids found inside this tag.
| Once this is defined, you can identify all the ids using the attribute
  “rid” for all the categories and properties. The resulting absolute
  ids will be computed as follow:

absolute_id = 2000000 + 1000 \* file_no + rid

| *Example: declaring a category with a rid = 17 would generate the
  following absolute id:*
| *absolute_id = 2000000 + 1000 \* 99 + 17 = 2099017*

For more information on this topic, please refer to
http://cast-projects.github.io/Extension-SDK/doc/writing_quality_rule.html#metamodel-ids

To declare the QR, you have to declare one property per QR. Each of
these properties must belong to a category. You can associate as many
properties as you want to a single category. This is [TOTO#1].

*Note: The Category and Property sets of ids are independent and so you
can have the same id for a Category and a property.*

Here is a minimal QR MetaModel declaration:

::

     <category name="ExampleCustomQualityRules" rid="61">
       <description>Example of a list of Custom Quality Rules</description>

       <property name="qualityRuleOne" type="integer" merge=”sum” rid="8">
         <description>Example of a Custom Quality Rule</description>
       </property>

       <property name="qualityRuleTwo" type="integer" merge=”sum” rid="17">
         <description>Another example of a Custom Quality Rule</description>
       </property>

     </category>

In addition to this basic declaration, you need some additional data
(i.e. attributes) in order to be compatible with all the AIP’s
applications:

::

     <category name="ExampleCustomQualityRules" rid="61">
       <description>Example of a Custom Quality Rule</description>
       <property name="qualityRuleOne" type="integer" merge=”sum” rid="8">
         <description>Example of a Custom Quality Rule</description>
         <attribute name="INF_TYPE"       intValue="3333333"/>
         <attribute name="INF_SUB_TYPE"   intValue="17" />
         <attribute name="ACCESS_APPVIEW" intValue="1" />
         <attribute name="ACCESS_HTML"    intValue="1" />
         <attribute name="ACCESS_CVS"     intValue="1" />
       </property>
     </category>

Only 2 of these additional attributes are to be changed here: “INF_TYP”
and INF_SUB_TYP”. These 2 data are somehow equivalent to the Category
and Property MetaModel and are still in use by some applications from
AIP ecosystem. You should have a range of possible values for these.
Note that uniqueness here is on the pair of id (INF_TYP / INF_SUB_TYP).

Usually, we choose one INF_TYP value for an analyzer or an extension (or
even a “kind” of data) and we list all the QR by increasing the
INF_SUB_TYP value from zero.

.. _section-1:

Finally, all the declared QualityRules have to be associated with the
DotNet analyzer so that the system can process them.

To do so, you have to make the category “\ **CAST_DotNet_Metricable**\ ”
inherit from all these newly created categories [TODO#2].

Note: “\ **CAST_DotNet_Metricable**\ ” is a partial category so you can
have as many occurrences as you want. For instance, you can have several
MetaModel files each of them containing this category with its local
inheritances.

Example:

::

     <partialCategory name="CAST_DotNet_Metricable">
       <inheritedCategory name="ExampleCustomQualityRules"/>
       <inheritedCategory name="AnotherListOfCustomQualityRules"/>
       <inheritedCategory name="YetAnotherListOfCustomQualityRules"/>
     </partialCategory>

MasterFiles
~~~~~~~~~~~

These files represent a fragment of an Assessment Model for an
extension. An Assessment Model contains the settings to trigger the rule
and to calculate the quality indicators, as well as the rule
documentation. A full documentation or even training should be provided
by a Cast Consultant but here we are only going to present the small
part required to compute QualityRules in the current context.

The only 2 required files here are “\ **IMPLQualityRules.xml**\ ” and
“\ **SPECDocumentation.xml**\ ”. They can be found in the
“\ **MasterFiles**\ ” folder of the project. Basic templates of these
files are provided so you simply have to edit them to add all the QRs
that have been developed. This will associate each MetaModel Property Id
(which is internal) with the corresponding Violation Id (which will be
published) and provide a documentation for each QR.

These two files contain a list of tags named **<metric>**, each of them
containing the definition of a QR. You have to add a new metric tag for
each of your QR [TODO#3].

First, you can define the documentation of your QR in the
“\ **SPECDocumentation.xml**\ ” file. Here you can specify the following
data:

-  | **id**: this is the metric id of the QR, i.e. the identifier of the
     QR in the assessment model.
   | **Beware that this Id must be an EVEN number greater than 2 000
     000.**
   | Usually a range should have been assigned to you. It must be unique
     in the whole Cast environment.

-  **originalName**: this is the name of the QR as it will appear in the
   resulting files.

-  **<english></english>**: tag that contain the documentation of the
   QR.

Example: **SPECDocumentation.xml**

::

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
   <root>
     <metric id="2010154" type="quality-rule" originalName="Example of a Custom Quality Rule" section="output">
       <english>This is the description of the QR</english>
     </metric>
   </root>

Then you have to add the entries in **IMPLQualityRules.xml**. For each
of metric tag, you have to setup at least 3 of its attributes:

-  **id**: The same as in the documentation.

-  **originalName**: The same as in the documentation.

-  **propertyID**: this is the Cast MetaModel property id of the QR. The
   absolute id corresponding to the property you have declared in the
   MetaModel file.

We will not address the rest of Assessment model here. So, you can leave
all the other tags with their default value for now.

Example:

::

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
   <root>
     <metric id="2010154" originalName="Example of a Custom Quality Rule" propertyID="2099017"  
      xxl="N/A" unify="N/A" type="quality-rule" executionLocation="N/A" 
      executionPrecedenceConstraint="N/A" scopeID="2001000" scopeLabel="SET_DotNet_Example" 
      diagnosisValueType="integer" localSiteInitialize="DSS_FILTER_SCOPE" 
      localSiteDiagnose="DSS_DIAG_SCOPE_GENERIC_NUM" localSiteCountViolations="count-distinct" 
      localSiteCountTotal="DSS_DIAG_TOTAL_GENERIC" centralSiteInitialize="N/A" />

   </root>

QR implementation files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The template provides a typical implementation of a QR containing a
generic implementation of each part.

Here is this generic implementation:

::

   namespace CastDotNetExtension
   {
       [CastRuleChecker]
       [DiagnosticAnalyzer(LanguageNames.CSharp)]
       // [TODO#4] Enter here the description of your QR
       [RuleDescription(
           Id = "YourCustomSpecificQRNameOrId",
           Title = "Your Custom Specific QR",
           MessageFormat = "The description of your QR",
           Category = "Maintainability",
           DefaultSeverity = DiagnosticSeverity.Warning,
           // [TODO#5] set the CastProperty to the qualified name of the Cast MetaModel property 
           //          identifying the Quality Rule (in the form: "CategoryName.propertyName")
           CastProperty = "CastCategoryNameOfTheQualityRule.propNameOfTheQualityRule"
       )]

// [**TODO#6]** name the class according to your QR

::

       public class TemplateCastQualityRule : AbstractRuleChecker
       {
           /// <summary>
           /// Initialize the QR with the given context and register all the syntax nodes
           /// to listen during the visit and provide a specific callback for each one
           /// </summary>
           /// <param name="context"></param>
           public override void Init(AnalysisContext context)
           {
               // [TODO#7] register the callbacks:
               context.RegisterSyntaxNodeAction(AnalyzeIfStatement, SyntaxKind.IfStatement);
           }

           // [TODO#8] Implement your callback function
           private void AnalyzeIfStatement(SyntaxNodeAnalysisContext nodeContext)
           {
               var ifStatement = nodeContext.Node as IfStatementSyntax;

               // [TODO#9] if a violation is found, store it using the following:
               if (ifStatement != null && ifStatement.Else == null)
               {
                   AddViolation(nodeContext);
               }
           }

       }
   }

Annotations: Setup the QR descriptor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First you have to fill the QR description parameters of the annotation
**RuleDescription**.

You will find all the ones corresponding to the
**Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.DiagnosticDescriptor** (Id, Title, etc.). This
is [TODO#4].

Then you have to provide a value for the **CastProperty** parameter
corresponding to the Category and Property names from the Cast
MetaModel. This is [TODO#5].

.. _section-2:

Name the class
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Since the name of the class will be the name exposed by the assembly, it
should be unique amongst the DotNet analyzer extensions and represent
your QR. This is [TODO#6].

.. _section-3:

“Constructor”
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| The default constructor configures the QR as reporting one violation
  per provided bookmark. If you prefer to report a violation with
  several bookmarks, you can change this with the parametrized
  constructor.
| Example:

::

   Public MyQualityRule() : base(ViolationCreationMode.ViolationWithAdditionalBookmarks) { }

.. _section-4:

“Init” method: Associate callback functions to some AST nodes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Edit the **Init** method in order to register all the callback functions
with the AST node you want to be called during the visit by the
analyzer. This is [TODO#7].

The AST nodes are members of the enum
**Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.SyntaxKind**.

The callback methods must have the signature defined above in this
document (in the **AbstractRuleChecker** class description).

.. _section-5:

Declare your callback functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All the functions associated to the AST nodes in the **Init** function
must be declared here. This is [TODO#8].

This is here that you a supposed to compute and detect the violations.
Once you have a result, you can store it by calling the **AddViolation**
function. This is [TODO#9].

Miscellaneous
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In addition to all this, you can add a “\ **Reset**\ ” method
(overriding the one from the base class), add a constructor or any data
or methods you might be needing to implement your QR.

Build the project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have built your project, you should get a folder
**Build\\x64\\Release** (from the root of the project sources). This
folder contains your extension that can be used directly with Carl.
Before being able to use in with AIP you would have to build a whole
Assessment model and register your extension in AIP environment (see AIP
documents about extensions on this topic).

For your information, the files generated by the build process are:

-  Your assembly is in the **Build\\x64\\Release** folder.

-  The Metamodel file should have been automatically copied to the to
   **Build\\x64\\Release\\Configuration\\Languages\\DotNet **

-  The Assessment Model file should have been copied to
   **Build\\x64\\Release\\MasterFiles**

Naming convention
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The folder containing your extension must have a name respecting a
specific convention: "**com.companyname.extensionname.x.y.z-stageNNN**",
where

-  "**companyname**" is your company or organisation name

-  "**extensionname**" is the name of your extension

-  "**x.y.z**" is the numerical version of your extension (e.g. 1.7.2)

-  "**stage**" (optional) is the release level of your extension (e.g.
   alpha, beta, etc.)

-  "**NNN**" (optional) is the build number.

Example: "**com.EID.DotNetQRExample.1.2.7**" or
"**com.EID.DotNetQRExample.2.0.1-beta1243**"

Using TemplateQualityRuleTests project to unitary test a QR
-----------------------------------------------------------

The template solution also provides a project named
**TemplateQualityRuleTests**, intending to unitary test the QR. These
tests are based on **NUnit** framework and are integrated into Visual
Studio Test Explorer. The main advantage here is to be able to test the
QR outside from any Cast environment such as AIP or Carl.

Setup the environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, you must add the assemblies containing the QRs to test to the
references of the testing project.

Then you can add all the source codes that will be used to test the QRs
to the resources of the project. To do so, you can add these source
files to the **TestSources** folder. Then, open the
“\ **SourcesToTest.resx**\ ” (in the folder **Properties**) and then add
all the files from **TestSources**.

You should get this kind of configuration:

*Note: We advise you to edit the properties for these source files in
order to prevent them from being compiled together with your code. To do
so, change the “\ *\ **Build Action**\ *\ ” from “\ *\ **Compile**\ *\ ”
to “\ *\ **None**\ *\ ”.*

Implement the test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As we saw for the implementation of the QR, we also provide a generic
test case to test a QR. This frame can be replicated and adapted to the
QR to test.

To test a QR, you have to use the **CastDotNetExtensionChecker** class.
It is generic and is to be parametrized with the class implementing the
QR to test. This checker will then be used in 3 steps:

1. configure

2. launch the analysis

3. check the results

Here is the basic test method:

::

       [TestFixture]
       class TemplateQualityRuleTests
       {
           /// Implementation of the test using the following template
           [Test]
           public void TestMethod1()
           {
               // [TODO#10] load the source code to test from resources
               // note: a source file should have been added to the resources 
               //       using the Resource file "SourcesToTest.resx"
               var testSrc = UnitTestTemplateCastQualityRules.Properties
                                                             .SourcesToTest
                                                             .SomeSourcesToTest;

               // [TODO#11] create the checker object, parametrized with the type of the QR to test
               var checker = CastDotNetExtensionChecker<TemplateCastQualityRule>.CreateInstance();
               Assert.IsTrue(checker != null);

               // [TODO#12] Configure the analysis
               checker.AddAssemblyRef(@"C:\Examples\Packages\myAssembly.dll");
               checker.AddSource(@"C:\Examples\Sources\toolbox.cs");
               checker.AddSource(@"C:\Examples\Sources\Config.xml");

               // [TODO#13] launch the processing on the given source code
               checker.Apply(testSrc);


               // [TODO#14] setup the expected bookmarks
               checker.AddExpected(10, 8).AddExpected(15, 8);

               // Launch the validation
               checker.Validate();

               // [TODO#15] Compare the results with the expectation
               Assert.IsTrue(checker.IsValid(), checker.getStatus());

               // NOTE: You can also check in more details:
               // Assert.IsFalse(checker.ResultsMissing.Any());
               // Assert.IsFalse(checker.ResultsUnexpected.Any());
           }
       }

Configure the checker
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First you have to retrieve the source code that will be used to test the
QR, i.e. extract it from the resources. This is [TODO#10].

Then you have to create an instance of the checker providing the class
to test as a generic parameter. Here, the generic parameter
“\ **TemplateCastQualityRule**\ ” must be replaced by the name of the
class to test. This is [TODO#11].

Optionally, you can add all the references and additional files that
could be required to fulfill the analysis. This is [TODO#12].

Launch the analysis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once the checker has been configured, we call the Apply function of the
checker in order to launch the analysis on the source code retrieved
from the resources. This is [TODO#13].

Check the results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can now add the expected results by adding the positions where some
violations are supposed to be found. You can add as many bookmarks as
you want, calling the AddExpected method for each of them. This is
[TODO#14].

*Note: Skipping this step allow you to check that no violations are
supposed to be found in order to implement some negative tests.*

Then, the validation is executed by calling the **Validate** method.

Finally, you can compare the results with the expectation using one of
the information provided by the checker:

-  “IsValid” function: return true if the results are equal to the
   expectation.

-  “getStatus” function: return a string listing the differences found.

-  “ResultsMissing” property: a list of all the expected bookmarks
   missing from the results

-  “ResultsUnexpected” property: a list of all the results produced but
   not expected.

Launch the tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once your extension and its related tests have been built with success,
you should find all your test cases in Visual Studio Test Explorer.

*Note: Using a Visual Studio 2017 or older, requires the installation of
the “\ *\ **NUnit 2 Test Adapter**\ *\ ”.*

*Tip: Do not forget to set the “Test Settings / Default Processor
Architecture” to “x64”.*

*Here is an example of the Test Explorer with 3 tests:*

Integration in Carl
-------------------

Once your extension has been successfully implemented, tested and the
resulting folder renamed according to the convention, you simply have to
copy this folder to Carl’s “\ **extensions**\ ” folder.

Then you can launch Carl with your newly implemented extension on a
bunch of C# sources.

Example:

::


   C:\CAST\com.castsoftware.carlcli.2.0.0-beta9> CarlCLI.exe -s C:\SRC\examples -o C:\CarlOut -a Test

Finally, you can retrieve the results in Carl output folder following
the indications given at the end of the execution.

Example:

::

      -> Results per source file: C:/CarlOutput/resultByFile
      -> Results per Quality Rule: C:/CarlOutput/resultByQualityRule


Using Parameters in QR
----------------------

The purpose is to access the value of an AssessmentModel's parameter within the code of a QR. As we will see, the value of these parameters can be customized in Carl's configuration file.

**Important Note: a parameter is always associated to one (and only one) QR.**

Declare a parameter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Open the ``IMPLParameters.xml`` file of the extension (that can be found in the MasterFiles folder). Add the parameter declarations you want associated with their respected QRs. 

Example:
Let's consider the following QR (defined in the IMPLQualityRules.xml file):

::

  <metric id="2200777" type="quality-rule" originalName="My first parametrized QR" xxl="N/A" unify="N/A" executionLocation="local-central" executionPrecedenceConstraint="N/A" scopeID="610" scopeLabel="SET_DOTNET_METHODS" propertyID="2200770" diagnosisValueType="integer" localSiteInitialize="DSS_FILTER_SCOPE" localSiteDiagnose="DSS_DIAG_SCOPE_GENERIC_NUM" localSiteCountViolations="count" localSiteCountTotal="DSS_DIAG_TOTAL_GENERIC" centralSiteInitialize="N/A" />

We will associate 2 new parameters to this QR:

::

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
   <root>
	   <metric id="2200777" type="quality-rule" originalName="My first parametrized QR" parameterName="PrefixSize" parameterType="integer" parameterIndex="1" filter="0" filterLabel="C#" parameterDescription="Minimal size of the prefix">
		   <defaultValue>5</defaultValue>
		   <defaultValuesList>N/A</defaultValuesList>
	   </metric>
	   <metric id="2200777" type="quality-rule" originalName="My first parametrized QR" parameterName="ForbiddenPrefix" parameterType="text-list" parameterIndex="2" filter="0" filterLabel="C#" parameterDescription="list of Forbidden prefixes">
		   <defaultValue></defaultValue>
		   <defaultValuesList>test debug</defaultValuesList>
	   </metric>
   </root>

You have to add one <metric> entry per parameter. 


The attributes are declared as follow (see the AssessmentModel documentation for more detailed informations):

* ``id``, ``type`` and ``originalName``: they define the QR associated to this new parameter.
* ``parameterName``: the name of your new parameter.
* ``parameterType``: the type of the parameter. It can have one of the following values: {``"integer"``, ``"float"``, ``"text"``, ``"text-list"``, ``"integer-list"``, ``"float-list"``}
* ``parameterIndex``: This is the index of the parameter for the associated QR starting from 1. This is used in AIP only.
* ``parameterDescription``: The "human friendly" definition of the parameter.

Each parameter comes with a default value depending on its type:

* If it is a single value ("integer", "float", "text"), the default value is indicated in the tag ``<defaultValue></defaultValue>``
* If it is a list of values ("text-list", "integer-list", "float-list"), the default values are in the tag ``<defaultValuesList><defaultValuesList>`` as a list of values separated by spaces.

Customize the values of the parameters in Carl configuration file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The default values of the parameters can be replaced by new ones at runtime when launching Carl. To do simply have to add a new sub section ``<RuleParameters>`` under the section ``<CARL>`` of Carl Configuration file.

Example:
The parameters defined above can be changed as follow:
::

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
   <configurations>
	   <CARL>
		   <RuleParameters>
			   <Rule id="2200020" parameterType="integer" parameterName="PrefixSize" techno="DotNet">
				   <value>8</value>
			   </Rule>
			   <Rule id="2200020" parameterType="text-list" parameterName="ForbiddenPrefix" techno="DotNet">
				   <value>test debug demo</value>
			   </Rule>
		   </RuleParameters>
	   </CARL>
   </configurations>

Each parameter is defined in a tag ``<Rule>`` which has the following attributes:

* ``id``: the id of the QR
* ``parameterType``, ``parameterName``: the identification of the parameter (same values as in ``IMPLParameters.xml`` file)
* ``techno``: the techno of the QR (``"DotNet"`` here obviously)
Then, the new value(s) can be set in the sub section ``<value>``. The values of a list must be separated by space as above.

Retrieve the parameters values with the code of a QR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Important Note: As mentioned before, the parameters are associated with a QR (in the AssessmentModel) while the analyzer only deals with properties (from the MetaModel). You can easily find the correspondance in the ``IMPLQualityRules.xml`` file where each ``<metric>`` entry declares the associated property with the attribute ``propertyID``.**

Once you have identified the property, you can edit the code of this rule and use the ``GetParameterValue(name)`` to retrieve the value of the parameter.
This method returns an obect of the class ``ParameterValue`` defined as follow:
::

    public enum ParameterType
        { is_integer, is_float, is_string, is_stringlist, is_intlist, is_floatlist, unknown }

    public class ParameterValue
    {
        public ParameterType Type { get; set; }
		
        public string ValueString { get; set; }
        public double ValueFloat { get; set; }
        public int ValueInteger { get; set; }
        public IEnumerable<string> ValueStringList { get; set; }
        public IEnumerable<int> ValueIntegerList { get; set; }
        public IEnumerable<double> ValueFloatList { get; set; }
    }

Descriptions of the properties:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* ``Type``: This is the type of the value corresponding to the definition of the parameter. Note: If the ``name`` argument provided to ``GetParameterValue`` is unknown for this QR, then the Type equals to ``ParameterType.unknown``.
* ``ValueString``: the ``string`` value for an ``is_string`` parameter. 
* ``ValueFloat``: the ``double`` value for an ``is_float`` parameter.
* ``ValueInteger``: the ``int`` value for an ``is_integer`` parameter.
* ``ValueStringList``: the ``list<string>`` value for an ``is_stringlist`` parameter.
* ``ValueIntegerList``: the ``list<int>`` value for an ``is_intlist`` parameter.
* ``ValueFloatList``: the ``list<double>`` value for an ``is_floatlist`` parameter.

**Example:**

Retrieving values of the parameters defined above would be as follow:

::

    [CastRuleChecker]
    [DiagnosticAnalyzer(LanguageNames.CSharp)]
    [RuleDescription(
        Id = "My first parametrized QR",
        Title = "My first parametrized QR",
        MessageFormat = "My first parametrized QR",
        Category = "Documentation - Style Conformity",
        DefaultSeverity = DiagnosticSeverity.Warning,
        CastProperty = "EIDotNetQualityRules.MyFirstParametrizedQR"
    )]
    public class MyFirstParametrizedQR : AbstractRuleChecker
    {

        /// <summary>
        /// Initialize the QR with the given context and register all the syntax nodes
        /// to listen during the visit and provide a specific callback for each one
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="context"></param>
        public override void Init(AnalysisContext context)
        {
            context.RegisterSymbolAction(AnalyzeMethodName, SymbolKind.Method);
        }

        private void AnalyzeMethodName(SymbolAnalysisContext context)
        {
			// --------------------------------------------------------------
            // Get the parameter with the name "PrefixSize"
            var prefixSize = GetParameterValue("PrefixSize");

            // Get the parameter value corresponding to the expected type
            int prefixSizeVal = 0;
            if (prefixSize.Type == ParameterType.is_integer)
            {
                prefixSizeVal = prefixSize.ValueInteger;
            }

			// --------------------------------------------------------------
            // Get the parameter with the name "ForbiddenPrefix"
            var forbiddenPrefix = GetParameterValue("ForbiddenPrefix");

            IEnumerable<string> forbiddenPrefixList = null;
            if (forbiddenPrefix.Type == ParameterType.is_stringlist)
            {
                forbiddenPrefixList = forbiddenPrefix.ValueStringList;
            }
            if (forbiddenPrefixList == null)
                forbiddenPrefixList = new List<string>();

            /* some code using prefixSizeVal and forbiddenPrefixList */

            /* ...... */
        }
    }
