This section explains how to install and configure the IDE for CAST-SDK.

This IDE is based on `eclipse <http://eclipse.org/eclipse/>`_.

The python interpretor is directly bundled in the CAIP install directory so you do not need to install python.

Two ways of installing
======================

Use a pre bundled eclipse 
-------------------------

First solution is to use a pre-bundled eclipse as follow :

1. You will need a java7 64-bit jre on your machine
2. Get ``\\fs01\fileexchange\MRO\CAST-SDK\eclipse.7z``
3. Unzip it to a folder of your choice.
4. Modify ``eclipse.ini`` to correctly point to your java7 64-bit
5. Run eclipe and check that you can see the Pydev eclipse component

Use another eclipse
-------------------

Second solution is to :

1. Install eclipse 3.4
2. Install `PyDev plugin <http://pydev.org/manual_101_install.html>`_. Read carefully the installtion manual, you will still need a java 7 jre.
3. Run eclipe and check that you can see the Pydev eclipse plugin

Some other eclipse components may prove usefull :

* Eclipse XML Editors and Tools for metamodel edition


Configuration of eclipse
========================

Whatever install soltuion chosen the PyDev eclipse plugin need to be configured in order to point to the python environment providedby CAIP.

Open your eclipse and go to ``Window > Preferences > PyDev > Interpreters > Python Interpreter`` and create a new interpreter. 
Give *CAST-Python34* as name and select the path to the python provided in the CAIP install dir ``<CAIP install dir>\ThirdParty\Python34\python.exe``.

You should get something like that:

.. figure::  config_interpreter.png
   :align:   center

   Select the interpreter from the CAIP install directory.

You are now ready to create your first plugin.

.. note::
    You can choose another name for the interpreter then importing sample project will require to change interpreter configuration in order to work.
