This section explains how to install and configure the IDE for CAST Extension SDK.

This IDE is based on `eclipse <http://eclipse.org/eclipse/>`_.


.. note::
    The python interpretor is directly bundled in the CAIP install directory so **you must not install python**.

Installing eclipse + pydev
==========================

1. `Install eclipse <https://eclipse.org/downloads/>`_
2. Install `PyDev plugin <http://pydev.org/manual_101_install.html>`_. Read carefully the installtion manual, you may need a recent java jre.
3. Run eclipe and check that you can see the Pydev eclipse plugin

Some other eclipse components may prove usefull :

* Eclipse XML Editors and Tools for metamodel edition


Configuration of eclipse
========================

The PyDev eclipse plugin need to be configured in order to point to the python environment provided by CAIP.

Open your eclipse and go to ``Window > Preferences > PyDev > Interpreters > Python Interpreter`` and create a new interpreter. 

Name it according to your CAIP version (eg 8.0.0) and select the path to the python provided in the CAIP install dir ``<CAIP install dir>\ThirdParty\Python34\python.exe``.

.. note:: 
    Note that you will be able to add as many interpreters you want so that you can test your extension against several CAIP versions. 

.. warning::
    Pydev has 3 *interperter* configurations. The one we are using is **Python Interpreter**.  

You should get something like that:

.. figure::  config_interpreter.png
   :align:   center

   Select the interpreter from the CAIP install directory.


You are now ready to create your first plugin.

.. note::
    You can choose another name for the interpreter when importing sample project will require to change interpreter configuration in order to work.
