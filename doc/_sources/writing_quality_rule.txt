Writing quality rules
*********************

Tutorial for COBOL
==================

This tutorial applies to **COBOL** but can be translated to other technologies.


Stater kit
----------

A sample project is available here : 
https://github.com/CAST-projects/Extension-SDK/tree/master/samples/analyzer_level/mainframe/mainframe.quality_rule

Have a look at git history.
https://github.com/CAST-projects/Extension-SDK/commits/master/samples/analyzer_level/mainframe/mainframe.quality_rule

Initialization
--------------


Plugin id
+++++++++

First you need to choose :

* a unique plugin id

This plugin id will be used in plugin.nuspec file.

In this tutorial we have chosen **mainframe.quality_rule**.

See :doc:`deployment`


Pck name
++++++++

Then you also need to have a unique name for the pck. 
We recommend that this name contain the the plugin id.

In this tutorial we have chosen **mainframe.sample.qr_metric_tree**.

This name is then used in the compile.bat::

    MasterFiles\MetricsCompiler.bat -encodeUA -inputdir MasterFiles -outputdir . -pck mainframe.quality_rule_metric_tree

Metamodel ids
+++++++++++++

Then you need to choose a metamodel file_id.

See https://doc.castsoftware.com/display/DOC83/xxxMetaModel.xml+file#xxxMetaModel.xmlfile-IDassignmentscheme

The absolute ids are 2,000,000 + 1,000 * file_no + rid

Here, as it is custom quality rule the level is **"client"** and we have chosen file_id **"1"**.

So the absolute ids are between 2,001,000 and 2,001,999.

We will use this id range both for metamodel and for quality rule ids.


A custom category
+++++++++++++++++

Then we need to choose a name for our custom category. This name should be globally unique and do not clash with other category names. 

Here we choose : **MyCompany_COBOL_Rules**.


This category is added to the COBOL programs, see  :ref:`mainframe_categories`.

Doing a mistake and having the same category name in 2 different extensions will prevent those extensions to be installed on the same CAIP instance.


Adding a new quality rule
-------------------------

For adding a new quality rule we need to add:

* a metamodel property on the mainframe object type (on which the rule applies)
* an implementation in extension SDK
* a declaration in the master files


Adding a property
-----------------

We add a property in our custom category, for that we need: 

* a name (that should be unique inside the category)
* a rid (that should be unique inside the metamodel file)
* an INF_SUB_TYPE (that should be unique inside the metamodel file)

By convention we set the lower range value for the INF_TYPE.

This gives ::

    <category name="MyCompany_COBOL_Rules" rid="0">
        <description></description>
        <!-- add new properties here, one for each quality rule -->
        
        <property name="paragraphRedefinition" type="integer" merge="sum" rid="0">
            <description>Redefinition of paragraph</description>
            <attribute name="ACCESS_APPVIEW" intValue="1"/>
            <attribute name="ACCESS_CVS" intValue="1"/>
            <attribute name="ACCESS_HTML" intValue="1"/>
            <attribute name="INF_TYPE" intValue="2001000"/>
            <attribute name="INF_SUB_TYPE" intValue="0"/>
        </property>
        
    </category>


Apply the formula to determine the absolute id value (2,000,000 + 1,000 * file_no + rid) : here the property id is 2001000.

Keep that value in mind.


Implementation in Python
------------------------

We will use :meth:`cast.analysers.Object.save_violation` to register a violation on some object at a given position in the code.

The property name will be : "MyCompany_COBOL_Rules.paragraphRedefinition"

See @todo


Adding the rule in the master files
-----------------------------------

Master files are the xml files located in MasterFiles subfolder.

Each one need to be updated to add a new quality rule.


First We need a unique rule id.

.. warning::
    Rule id must be **even**.

We start by choosing **2001000**, next one will be 2001002, etc...


MetricsDirectory.xml
++++++++++++++++++++

This one contains the list of quality rules.

It also contains some existing 'technical-criterion' to which rules should be added.

Here we provide some classical 'technical-criterion', but some other exists.

Here is what change ::

    <metric id='2001000' type='quality-rule' originalName='Avoid redefining paragraph' active='true' detached='false' ignored='false' />



IMPLQualityRules.xml
++++++++++++++++++++

This explains how the rule is calculated.

Here we are in a property/scope mode.

Here we need to choose a scope : this represent the set of objects checked by the rule. 

Here we are checking every COBOL program, so we choose scope id 100. See see  :ref:`mainframe_scopes`.

We have 

* our rule id : 2001000
* our property id : 2001000
* our scope id : 100 

::

    <metric id='2001000' type='quality-rule' originalName='Avoid redefining paragraph' xxl='N/A' unify='N/A' executionLocation='local-central' scopeID='100' scopeLabel='NO LABEL' propertyID='2001000' associatedValueResultType='integer' failedChecksOperator1='count-distinct' failedChecksProcedure='DSS_DIAG_SCOPE_GENERIC_NUM' totalChecksProcedure='DSS_DIAG_TOTAL_GENERIC' consolidationLocalProcedure='DSS_FILTER_SCOPE' consolidationCentralProcedure='N/A' />


See "Computing Settings tab" in https://doc.castsoftware.com/display/DOC83/CMS+-+Create+a+new+Quality+Rule.



SPECThresholds.xml
++++++++++++++++++

This describe how we get a grade from a compliance ratio.

::

    <metric id="2001000" type="quality-rule" originalName="Avoid redefining paragraph" thresholdToGet1='50.0' thresholdToGet2='90.0' thresholdToGet3='95.0' thresholdToGet4='99.0' />

See "Grade Thresholds tab" in https://doc.castsoftware.com/display/DOC83/CMS+-+Create+a+new+Quality+Rule.



SPECContributors.xml
++++++++++++++++++++

This describe to which 'technical-criterion' the rule will contribute.

::
    
    <metric id='66069' type='technical-criterion' originalName='Programming Practices - Unexpected Behavior' contributorId='2001000' contributorType='quality-rule' contributorOriginalName='2001000' critical='false' weight='5' />

See "Grade Impacts tab" in https://doc.castsoftware.com/display/DOC83/CMS+-+Create+a+new+Quality+Rule.


IMPLTechnologies.xml
++++++++++++++++++++

Rules are associated to one or several technologies.

In this sample the technology is Cobol, so -4

::

    <metric id='2001000' type='quality-rule' originalName='Avoid redefining paragraph' filter='-4' filterLabel='Cobol' />

See "Computing Settings tab" in https://doc.castsoftware.com/display/DOC83/CMS+-+Create+a+new+Quality+Rule.


SPECDocumentation.xml
+++++++++++++++++++++

This contains the various fields of documentation.

See https://doc.castsoftware.com/display/DOC83/CMS+-+Create+a+new+Quality+Rule


Compiling the master files
--------------------------

Once edited, you can compile the master files by running compile.bat *in a console* ran the folder of the extension.

It will generate a folder named InstallScripts


Done
----

That's it. Now you can test.
 


Some other ways of writing quality rules
========================================


Those applies for some other ways of writing quality rules, some are deprecated. 


Old way of writing quality rules
--------------------------------

For the implementation, two stored procedures are required:

* A detail procedure to identify violations
* A total procedure to compute the size of the test population

The detail procedure will insert lines into DSS_METRIC_SCOPES representing the fact that an object violates a rule.

Sample for the search of undocumented programs ::
	
	CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION DIAG_SCOPE_COBDOC004 (
		I_SNAPSHOT_ID INT,		-- the metric snapshot id
		I_METRIC_PARENT_ID INT,	-- the metric parent id
		I_METRIC_ID INT,			-- the metric id
		I_METRIC_CHILD_ID INT
	)
	returns INT
	as
	$body$
	declare
		   ERRORCODE	INT:=0;
	Begin
	     
	--<<NAME>>DIAG_SCOPE_COBDOC004<</NAME>>
	--<<COMMENT>> Template name   = UNDOCUMENTED. <</COMMENT>>
	--<<COMMENT>> Diagnostic name = Avoid undocumented Programs. <</COMMENT>>
	--<<COMMENT>> Definition      = Avoid undocumented Programs. <</COMMENT>>
	--<<COMMENT>> Action          = Lists all Programs that have neither heading comments nor inline comments. <</COMMENT>>
	--<<COMMENT>> Value           = 1. <</COMMENT>>
		
	  insert into DSS_METRIC_SCOPES 
		(OBJECT_ID, METRIC_PARENT_ID, METRIC_ID, OBJECT_PARENT_ID, SNAPSHOT_ID, METRIC_NUM_VALUE, METRIC_OBJECT_ID, COMPUTE_VALUE)
	  select T1.OBJECT_ID, I_METRIC_ID, I_METRIC_CHILD_ID, SC.MODULE_ID, I_SNAPSHOT_ID, 1, 0, 0
	    from CTT_OBJECT_APPLICATIONS T1, DSSAPP_MODULES SC , ObjInf OI
		where SC.TECHNO_TYPE					= -4   -- Technologic Cobol object
		  and T1.APPLICATION_ID			= SC.MODULE_ID
	      and T1.OBJECT_TYPE 				= 545 -- 'Cobol Program'
		  and T1.PROPERTIES = 0 -- Application's Object
		  and not exists ( select 1 
		                     from DSS_OBJECT_EXCEPTIONS E
				            where E.METRIC_ID	= I_METRIC_ID 
					          and E.OBJECT_ID	= T1.OBJECT_ID 
			              )
	      and exists ( select 1 
		                  from ObjInf T2
					     where T2.IdObj = T1.OBJECT_ID
	                       and T2.InfTyp = 114 and T2.InfSubTyp = 1 -- Number of heading comment lines
						   and T2.InfVal = 0
			           )
		  and exists ( select 1
		                  from ObjInf T3
					     where T3.IdObj = T1.OBJECT_ID
	                       and T3.InfTyp = 2 and T3.InfSubTyp = 0 -- Number of inner comment lines
						   and T3.InfVal = 0
			           )
	     
	and T1.OBJECT_ID = OI.IdObj and OI.InfTyp    = 1 and OI.InfSubTyp = 0 and OI.InfVal > 0 -- has Code line 
	
		  
	 	;    
	Return ERRORCODE;
	End;
	$body$
	language 'plpgsql'
	/


A total procedure insert lines into DSS_METRIC_RESULTS that represent the count of scanned objects.

For example the detail procedure for the undocumented programs ::

	CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION DIAG_COBOL_ANA_PROGRAM_TOTAL (
		I_SNAPSHOT_ID          INT,		-- the metric snapshot id
		I_METRIC_PARENT_ID     INT,	-- the metric parent id
		I_METRIC_ID            INT,			-- the metric id
		I_METRIC_VALUE_INDEX   INT
	)
	returns int
	as
	$body$
	declare
		ERRORCODE	int;
	Begin
	    ERRORCODE  := 0;
	--<<NAME>>DIAG_COBOL_ANA_PROGRAM_TOTAL<</NAME>>*/
	--<<COMMENT>> Template name   = TOTAL. <</COMMENT>>
	--<<COMMENT>> Definition      = Count of program programs. <</COMMENT>>
	
	    Insert Into DSS_METRIC_RESULTS
			(METRIC_NUM_VALUE, METRIC_OBJECT_ID, OBJECT_ID, METRIC_ID, METRIC_VALUE_INDEX, SNAPSHOT_ID)
	    select 
			Count(T1.OBJECT_ID), 0, SC.OBJECT_PARENT_ID, I_METRIC_ID, I_METRIC_VALUE_INDEX, I_SNAPSHOT_ID 
	    from 
	    	CTT_OBJECT_APPLICATIONS T1, DSSAPP_MODULES MO, DSS_METRIC_SCOPES SC
	    where                    
		    SC.SNAPSHOT_ID             	= I_SNAPSHOT_ID
		    and SC.METRIC_PARENT_ID    	= I_METRIC_PARENT_ID
		    and SC.METRIC_ID           	= I_METRIC_ID
	 		and SC.COMPUTE_VALUE		= 0
			and MO.TECHNO_TYPE			= -4   -- Technologic Cobol object
			and MO.MODULE_ID			= SC.OBJECT_ID
	  		and T1.APPLICATION_ID      	= SC.OBJECT_ID
			and T1.OBJECT_TYPE			=     545 -- 'Cobol Program'
			and T1.PROPERTIES = 0 -- Application's Object
			
			and Not Exists 
			(
				select 1 
				from 
					DSS_OBJECT_EXCEPTIONS E
				where 
					E.METRIC_ID		= I_METRIC_ID 
					and E.OBJECT_ID	= T1.OBJECT_ID 
			)
	    Group By SC.OBJECT_PARENT_ID, SC.OBJECT_ID
		; 
	Return ERRORCODE;
	End;
	$body$
	language 'plpgsql'
	/


Those procedures uses the object model stored in the knowledge base. This uses objects and properties.

One can use existing properties, and also use new properties (that the should be produced)



Different ways of producing properties
--------------------------------------

The values of the properties may be produced using various ways :

* through SDK using either :meth:`cast.analysers.Object.save_violation` or :meth:`cast.application.Object.save_property`
* using Metric Assistant : http://doc.castsoftware.com/display/DOC80/Using+the+XXXCastMetrics.xml+file
  by adding a xxxCastMEtrics.xml file in your extension
