    The full code tutorial is provided :download:`here <samples/my.company.first_plugin.7z>`.

Setting up the environment
==========================

Create a new ``Pydev Project`` named ``my.company.first_plugin``.

.. figure::  create_project.png
   :align:   center
   
   Create a project for your plugin.

Choose ``3.0`` for ``Grammar Version`` and the interpreter you declared before.

Create the plugin
=================  

In that project create a ``python module`` named ``main``.

Create your plugin class in ``main.py``::

    import cast.analysers.dotnet
    import cast.analysers.log

    class MyExtension(cast.analysers.dotnet.Extension):

        def start_analysis(self,options):
            cast.analysers.log.debug('Hello World!!')

This will automatically register a .Net extension and create a plugin.

Create your first test
----------------------

You can then test your plugin directly from eclipse.

In your project create a ``pydev package`` named ``tests``. 
In that new package create a new module named ``basic_test`` and choose ``Module: Unittest as template``.

Give the test method the name you like, we will start by launching a DotNet analysis in a test environment::

    import unittest
    import cast.analysers.test

    class Test(unittest.TestCase):
        def testRegisterPlugin(self):
            # create a DotNet analysis
            analysis = cast.analysers.test.DotNetTestAnalysis()
            # DotNet need a selection of a csproj
            analysis.add_selection('AProject/AProject.csproj')
            analysis.set_verbose()
            analysis.run()
        
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        unittest.main()

Select ``basic_test.py`` and with right click do ``Run As > Python Run``

The test should then run and print the CAIP analysis log to console. 
Among the other analysis messages you should see:: 

    ...
    Registering plugin my.company.first_plugin.
    ...
	[my.company.first_plugin] Hello World!!

It means that it works.

.. note::
    What we did here is to analyse a sample DotNet csproj. We have stored this sample directly inside the ``tests`` folder. 
   
    The analysis is performed whithout cast-ms. There is no need to have any CAIP databases installed. 
    
    The idea is that developper can tune it's plugin code rapidly and build a full non regression test suite.

Now you can override other events.

Perform some checks on analysis results
---------------------------------------

When using the developement environment, analysis results are stored into temporary files and are accessible from inside unit tests.

After the run of the analysis we cna check for presence or absence of objects and links.

For example::

        def testCheckInheritanceLink(self):
            # create a DotNet analysis
            analysis = cast.analysers.test.DotNetTestAnalysis()
            # DotNet need a selection of a csproj
            analysis.add_selection('AProject/AProject.csproj')
            analysis.set_verbose()
            analysis.run()
        
            # perform some checks
            my_class = analysis.get_object_by_name('AClass','CAST_DotNet_ClassCSharp')
            self.assertTrue(my_class)
            object_class = analysis.get_object_by_fullname('System.Object', 'CAST_DotNet_ClassExternal')
            self.assertTrue(object_class)
            link = analysis.get_link_by_caller_callee('inheritExtendLink', my_class, object_class)
            self.assertTrue(link)

In that sample we check for the presence of two classes and of a link between them.

In debugging mode, the whole result is accessible through ``analysis.result``.
