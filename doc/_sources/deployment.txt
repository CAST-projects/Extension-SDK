Deploying plugins
*****************


How to deploy a plugin into CAIP version >= 8.0.0
=================================================

Copy the plugin folder into : ``%ALLUSERSPROFILE%/CAST/CAST/Extensions``

You may also redefine the variable ``CAST_PLUGINS_ROOT_PATH`` in ``CastGlobalSettings.ini`` for replacing ``%ALLUSERSPROFILE%/CAST/CAST/Extensions`` by a custom location.

.. note:: 
    During the development phase, the best way to go is to have the ecplise project pointing to the deployed plugin.


.. figure::  deploy800.png
   :align:   center
   
   Result of a correct deploy.

.. note::
    Deploying the tests folder is 'optional'.

Then activate the plugin for a combined install though servman 'Manage Extensions'.

Run CAIP as usual, you should see the log messages during anlysis.

    
How to deploy a plugin into CAIP version <= 8.0.0
=================================================

Before 8.0.0, the deploy/servman phase is different. 

Copy the plugin folder into : ``<flat path>/CustomPlugins``; create the folder if needed.


After deploying some plugin this should give something like : 

.. figure::  deploy.png
   :align:   center
   
   Result of a correct deploy.

Then, if your plugin contains Metamodel or InstallScript components go to servman and perform 'Component Reinstall'.
