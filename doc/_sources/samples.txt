    Samples are importable eclipse projects. It assume that interpreter is named CAST-Python34.

My first plugin
===============

:download:`A very basic plugin <samples/my.company.first_plugin.7z>`.

A 'hello world!' tutorial sample.


Running an external program
===========================

It is possible to launch any executable through python. 

In that example we launch nodejs.exe that run jslint on all javascript files present in the analysis.

We also demonstrate how to declare properties on existing objects and use them as violations.

:download:`A basic jslint integration <samples/com.castsoftware.jslint.7z>`. 

Create link from class to table through annotation or convention
================================================================

:download:`A basic annotation sample <samples/sample.annotation.7z>`. 

Search for a particular annotation on classes, then select the given name or class name as a database table and try to create a use link to that table.

Create a custom object from a new type
======================================

A plugin can contains its own metamodel files.

Here we add a new object type, and we create one of those object under each file.

Getting the source code of an object
====================================

Saved objects have positions and those positions allow us to retreive the source code of an object.

An example of context usage
===========================

Plugin context is kept so it may keep object references throughout the analysis. 

In that example we keep all classes so that we can determine the list of subclasses of any class.
