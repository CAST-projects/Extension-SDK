Tips and tricks
===============

Respect the suggested structure
-------------------------------

Put your test in a subfolder just under your plugin python file. Otherwise, running will not work.

Auto completion in eclipse
--------------------------

`PyDev plugin for eclipse <http://pydev.org/index.html>`_ may needs some help in finding the correct type of a variable. For example in your extension point overrides::

    def start_member(self,member):
        """
        @type member: cast.analysers.Member
        """
        cast.analysers.log.debug('  Starting member ' + str(member))

Use ``@type`` annotations in comments to help the editor finding the correct type. 
Those annotations are already set in the provided templates.

Tests with the external links
-----------------------------

It is possible to stay inside the development environment and still having dependencies to server analysis. Use :func:`cast.analysers.test.TestAnalysis.add_database_table` to register a table::

    analysis = cast.analysers.test.DotNetTestAnalysis()
    ...
    analysis.add_database_table('Course','TSQL')
    analysis.add_database_table('CourseInstructor','TSQL')
    ...


Some notable usefull python libraries
-------------------------------------

The provided python distribution contains a lot of usefull libraries :

* `lxml <http://lxml.de/>`_ for reading/writing xml files
* `sqlparse <https://sqlparse.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ for non validating sql parsing
